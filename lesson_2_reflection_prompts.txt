What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Ans : When we initialize a git repository a hidden directory is created under the current directory named .git.
      This directory contains all the meta data discribing the changes. We need to do it because till we initialize 
      the reposetory we can not track the changes.
      Initializing a repository does not creat any comments due to two reasons 1st not all the files in the directory 
      need to be version controled. 2nd we will not be able to specifiy the commit massage.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Ans : working directory is the directory where a user is working. repository is a git repository which holds the source
     control data. where as staging are is a temporory area were user can sellectively add the files to be tracked 
	by git repository
